A repository to store miscellaneous work or tests related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

# Description of the files and folders in repository:


A program that creates, trains and evaluates different ANNs and CNNs on the MNIST data.  This was made to check how computational times differ between different devices (e.g. my desktop CPU and my cousins GPU).

For each of four different batch sizes, it creates, trains and evaluates each neural network on the MNIST data.
